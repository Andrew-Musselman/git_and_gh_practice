I am motivated to start a new career because I see my career in retail as a dead end. Retail is changing so fast with more consumers shopping online. My role in a store setting has very limited growth opportunity, and the benefits and pay are not great. The tech industry is a world of growth right now, coding is an excellent opportunity for me to break into that industry, and the entry level pay is far more than I would hope to make in a retail setting - even after my years of experience. I also feel like coding is a discipline that I am better suited for anyway. I deeply enjoy problem solving and logic, which are skills that I do not get to implement in my current line of work very often.
